	# Guidelines for running the code:
		1.1 The program requires the following libraries: math, numpy
		
	# Input:
		2.1 The program asks for initial values of psi, theta, phi, dx, dy, dz.
		2.2 The values of psi, theta and phi are asked in degrees unit.
	
	# Output:
		3.1 The program calculates the area of the ellipse formed on the XY plane and prints it.
		
	# Example 1:

	#	input:
			Enter rotation about x in degrees (psi): 0
			Enter rotation about y in degrees (theta): 0
			Enter rotation about z in degrees (phi): 50
			Enter final x coordinate(dx): 10
			Enter final y coordinate(dy): 10
			Enter final z coordinate(dz): 10

	#	output:
			The area on covered on the XY Plane is:  314.15926535897944
			

	# Example 2:

	#	input:
			Enter rotation about x in degrees (psi): 22
			Enter rotation about y in degrees (theta): -12
			Enter rotation about z in degrees (phi): 160
			Enter final x coordinate(dx): 12
			Enter final y coordinate(dy): 24
			Enter final z coordinate(dz): 4

	#	output:
			The area on covered on the XY Plane is:  1223.6868701664544
